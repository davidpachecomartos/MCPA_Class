# API Glossary

## A

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other.

### Authentication
The process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Common methods include API keys, OAuth tokens, and basic authentication.

### Authorization
The process of determining if a user or system has permission to perform a specific action or access specific data.

## B

### Base URL
The root URL for all API requests. This is the starting point for the API and includes the scheme (http/https) and the domain.

### Bearer Token
A type of token that is used in authentication to allow access to resources. It is typically included in the HTTP header.

## C

### Client
An application or system that makes requests to an API to retrieve or manipulate data.

### CRUD
An acronym for Create, Read, Update, Delete - the four basic operations that can be performed on resources in a database or API.

## D

### Documentation
Detailed information on how to use an API, including endpoints, parameters, request methods, and response formats.

## E

### Endpoint
A specific URL path in an API that performs a particular function, such as retrieving data or submitting data.

### Error Code
A code returned by an API to indicate the success or failure of a request. Common codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).

## H

### Header
Part of an HTTP request or response that contains metadata, such as content type, authorization information, and caching policies.

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
The protocol used for transferring data over the web. APIs typically use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions.

## J

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Commonly used in API responses.

## P

### Parameter
A variable in an API request that provides additional information to the server. Parameters can be sent in the query string, path, or request body.

### Payload
The data sent in the body of an HTTP request, often in JSON format, especially in POST or PUT requests.

## R

### Rate Limiting
A mechanism to control the number of API requests a client can make in a given time period to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)
An architectural style for designing networked applications that relies on stateless, client-server communication, typically using HTTP.

## S

### SDK (Software Development Kit)
A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that helps developers create applications for a specific platform or API.

### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
A protocol for exchanging structured information in web services, relying on XML and typically used in enterprise settings.

### Status Code
A code that indicates the result of an HTTP request. Common codes include 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), and 401 (Unauthorized).

## T

### Token
A piece of data that represents the authorization to access resources. Tokens are often used in authentication and authorization processes.

### Throttling
A technique to limit the rate at which a client can make requests to an API to prevent overloading the server.

## U

### URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
A string that identifies a resource either by location (URL) or by name (URN).

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A specific type of URI that indicates the location of a resource on the internet.

## W

### Webhook
An API concept that allows applications to send real-time data to other applications when a specific event occurs. Webhooks are typically triggered by events in one system and send data to another system.

### WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
An XML-based language for describing web services and how to access them. Commonly used with SOAP APIs.

## X

### XML (Extensible Markup Language)
A markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Used in some APIs, especially SOAP.
